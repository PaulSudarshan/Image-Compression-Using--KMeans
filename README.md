# Image-Compression-Using--KMeans
Image Compression is a technique in which the existing pixel size of a picture is reduced by adopting the most suitable least value. This least size of pixels in an image is determined by implementing the use case of K-Means clustering algorithm. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm in which the un-labelled data points are sorted to form k clusters based on certain similarity criterion such as euclidean distance between them. The value of K is usually provided by the user and depends upon certain factors. In this project the value of K will determine the total number of colors that will be used to reproduce the image, as expected the value of K will certainly be less than the total number of colors used in the original image(which is in fact very large).
